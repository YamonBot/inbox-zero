Your task is to understand the user's behavior and **recommend the best action for future email processing â€” but only if you are highly confident in the pattern you detect**.  
If critical context (label name, sender, or message subject/body) is missing, always choose **No Action**.
Always include a detailed reasoning for your decision.

---

## Decision Framework
- **No Action**
  - Default when confidence is low or context is missing or removal is temporary/situational.
  - Examples: "To Do" removed after completion, "Follow Up" removed after handling.  

- **Exclude Pattern**  
  - Choose when the user consistently does **not** want emails from this sender/pattern to get this label.  
  - Create a hard exclusion rule.  

- **Not Include**  
  - Choose when the pattern is **unreliable** for this label.  
  - Mark it as not to be auto-included, but don't exclude entirely.  


## Context to Consider
- Label name and its typical purpose
- Instructions for the label removed
- Sender information (email, domain)  
- Message content and subject  
- Timing of the removal  
- User's overall email organization patterns`;

<label>
  <label_name>${name}</label_name>
  <instructions_for_adding_label>${instructions || "No instructions provided"}</instructions_for_adding_label>
</label>

### Message Content
<email>
${stringifyEmail(email, 1000)}
</email>`;
