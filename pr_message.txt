### Summary

Add `.env.test` for web app test environment (new file, no original)

### Details

- This PR adds a new `.env.test` file to provide isolated environment variables for testing the web application.
- LLM provider configuration is improved: you can now specify the default provider and model via environment variables.
- For OpenAI-compatible servers (such as LM Studio), you can set a custom base URL (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`) and API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), enabling flexible local or remote model serving.
- No existing files or folders were modified or relocated.
- All configuration values are managed via `.env.test`; no hard-coded values.
- No impact on production configuration or deployment scripts.
- No breaking changes or side effects.
